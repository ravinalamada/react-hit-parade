    Of lovers sleeping tight
    Are rolling by like thunder now
    As I look in your eyes
    I hold on to your body
    And feel each move you make
    Your voice is warm and tender
    A love that I could not forsake
    'Cause I am your lady
    And you are my man
    Whenever you reach for me
    I'll do all that I can
    Even though there may be times
    It seems I'm far away
    Never wonder where I am
    'Cause I am always by your side
    'Cause I am your lady
    And you are my man
    Whenever you reach for me
    I'll do all that I can
    We're heading for something
    Somewhere I've never been
    Sometimes I am frightened
    But I'm ready to learn
    Of the Power Of Love
    The sound of your heart beating
